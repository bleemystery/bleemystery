Brian Lee | Lead Researcher @ Mystery Enterprises

I spearhead the development and formalization of technical standards for **Automated Murder Mystery Games (AMMG)**. My work focuses on the architectural design of **Bimodal Information Distribution (BID)** systems and the empirical measurement of facilitation latency ($L_f$) in peer-to-peer social environments.

## 🔬 Current Research Focus
- **AMMG Framework:** Eliminating the "Host Burden" in immersive group play.
- **BID Architecture:** Ensuring 100% participant equity via dual-node data distribution.
- **Latency Optimization:** Reducing game-state transitions to <30 seconds.
